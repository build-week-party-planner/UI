### Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
>no

### Are you required to pay to use the API?
>no

### Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
>no


## For Data Scientists

### Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.


### You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.


### Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)


### A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app


## Target Audience

### Who is your target audience? Be specific.
>Parents, Millennials, People who are the main planners of their friends, Any event planners

### What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
>For bigger events, budgeting is important, poor existing tools

### Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
>Card-sorting surveys (5 people), User interviews (2), proto-personas/personas (2), UX Workshop with 2 other UX Designers
>Research

### Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

## Prototype Key Feature(s)

### This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
>Our key features are number of guests, theme, date, budget, adding photos, planning entertainment, creating a shopping list, ability to mark items as purchased and have it affect the budget, adding new categories to track. We estimate that it will take 4 days to complete all the features.
